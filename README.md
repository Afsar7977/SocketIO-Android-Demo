# SocketIO-Android-Demo

Socket.IO provides you real-time bidirectional event based communication,which is very suitable for multiplayer games or real time communication.
Socket.IO provides the real-time communication for server and client.
Here Both server and client can emit and listen their calls.

Server also can trigger the event on specific route which are listened by their subscribers.
Means client which has putted their listener for particular events.
Socket.io is event-based. Both server and client emitting an event and listening to event from each other. 
(It is like we set an OnClickListener for our button in android.)

A simple HTTP handshake takes place at the beginning of a Socket.IO connection.
By using room and namespace, you can categorize sockets in the way you want.
